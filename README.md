## About passbolt browser extension

A browser extension is needed to maintain a higher level of security, e.g. to ensure the integrity of the
cryptographic code and provide a secure random number generator. In the future it will also be used to provide feature such as
auto filling your passwords when visiting known websites.

# Quick how-to for developers
This is just a quick getting started guide, for more information and productivity tips checkout CONTRIBUTING.md

## Prerequisite

You will need:
1. Nodejs
2. JPM the Node base Firefox Addon SDK (jetpack), see. [Official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation)
3. This code
```
git clone git@github.com:passbolt/passbolt_firefox.git
sudo npm install jpm -g
```

## Test a local version of the plugin

To launch an instance of Firefox with your local version of the add-on installed,
you will need make sure you run an instance that allowed unsigned extension (the developer edition for example)
```
jpm run -b /path/to/FirefoxAllowingUnsignedExtension
```
On MacOS that will be something like this:
```
jpm run -b /Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app
```

# FAQ
## How to keep the same extension id at each build
A key (key.pem) has to be provided by the passbolt team (Cedric) and should be put at the root folder before 
the grunt build.
