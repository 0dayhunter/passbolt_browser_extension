# Contributing to passbolt

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in passbolt. We welcome contributions from everyone, this guide is here to help you get started!

### How can you help?

There are several ways you can help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt/issues) on GitHub, if you have found a bug or want to propose a new feature or a change request.
* Review [enhancement or new feature requests](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt/issues) and contribute to the functional or technical specifications in the issues.
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues, preferably with test cases included
* Contribute to the [documentation](https://passbolt.com/help).
* Help design the proposed changes by editing the [styleguide](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_styleguide) or by submitting changes in the [wireframes](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_wireframes).
* Write unit test cases to help increase [test coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/passbolt/passbolt).
* Extend the [selenium test suite](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_selenium) for any open bug or change requests

If you have any suggestions or want to get involved in other ways feel free to get in touch with us at [contact@passbolt.com](mailto:contact@passbolt.com)!

### Code of Conduct

First things first, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://www.passbolt.com/code_of_conduct).
Help us keep Passbolt open and inclusive!

## High level guidelines

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we have a chance of keeping on top of things.

### Reporting a security Issue

If you've found a security related issue in Passbolt, please don't open an issue in GitHub.
Instead contact us at contact@passbolt.com. In the spirit of responsible disclosure we ask that the reporter keep the
issue confidential until we announce it.

The passbolt team will take the following actions:
- Try to first reproduce the issue and confirm the vulnerability.
- Acknowledge to the reporter that weâ€™ve received the issue and are working on a fix.
- Get a fix/patch prepared and create associated automated tests.
- Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
- Release new versions of all affected major versions.
- Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement.
- Provide credits in the release announcement to the reporter if they so desire.

### Reporting regular issues

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* If you are planning to start a new functionality or create a major change request, write down the functional and technical specifications first.
  * Create a document that is viewable by everyone
  * Define the problem you are trying to solve, who is impacted, why it is important, etc.
  * Present a solution. Explaining your approach gives an opportunity for other people to contribute and avoid frictions down the line.
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt/issues)
  * Check first that a similar issue does not already exist.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue if it is a bug.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug and/or a link to the specification document
  * If applicable, allow people to visualize your proposed changes via changes to the [styleguide](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_styleguide)

### Making code changes

#### Which branch to base the work?

* Bugfix branches will be based on master.
* New features that are backwards compatible will be based on next minor release branch.
* New features or other non backwards compatible changes will go in the next major release branch.

#### Make changes locally first
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a feature branch based on master; `git branch
    feature/ID_feature_description master` then checkout the new branch with `git
    checkout feature/ID_feature_description`. Better avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch, to avoid conflicts if you pull in updates from origin.
* Make commits of logical units.

#### Before submiting changes
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Use descriptive commit messages and reference the #issue number.
* Browser extension unit test cases should continue to pass.
* Selenium tests should continue to pass. See [passbolt selenium test suite](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_selenium) (see faq bellow).


# Tools & Workflow FAQ

If you are a programmer and wish to contribute / extend passbolt extension, here is what you need to know.
## Prerequisite

You will need:
1. Nodejs
2. JPM the Node base Firefox Addon SDK (jetpack), see. [Official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation)
3. This code
```
git clone git@github.com:passbolt/passbolt_firefox.git
sudo npm install jpm -g
```

## Launch the browser with a custom version of the plugin

To launch an instance of Firefox with your local version of the add-on installed,
you will need make sure you run an instance that allowed unsigned extension (the developer edition for example)
```
jpm run -b /path/to/FirefoxAllowingUnsignedExtension
```
On MacOS that will be something like this:
```
jpm run -b /Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app
```

## Runs the add-on's unit tests.

The test suite is rather slim at the moment but you can run it here:
```
jpm test
```
Contributions are welcomed if you want to extend it!

## Packaging the addon

Package your add-on as an XPI file, which is the install file format for Firefox add-ons.
The default grunt job will create two XPI, one with a debug mode set and another one to be used in production.
```
grunt
```
You can also do the following:
```
jpm xpi
```

## Push a new version

To push a new version of the plugin, and before submitting it to mozilla,
it is important to tag it :
```
git commit -am 'X.X.X'
git tag -a X.X.X -m 'X.X.X'
git push origin X.X.X
git push origin develop
```

## Productivity

While developing you'll frequently need to update your firefox plugin to test
it. Install the firefox "Extension Auto-Installer" which makes the testing process
lighter if you want to reuse an existing firefox instance and profile.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/autoinstaller/

By default it is disabled, go on the configuration page and activate it.

To compile the plugin in both non-debug and debug version, use the following command :
```
grunt [jpmxpi]
```
It will create the debug and non debug versions, as well as a symbolic link passbolt-latest@passbolt.com.xpi pointing to the non debug version.

To udpate your plugin in firefox after a change, go on your projet root and execute the following:
```
jpm xpi ; wget --post-file=passbolt.xpi http://localhost:8888/
```
or
```
grunt xpiinstall
```

## How to install / update openpgp

By default, openpgpjs as provided in the official repository cannot work
in the add-on environment. So we have developed some scripts to patch it.

To install or update openpgp:
```
	grunt lib-openpgp-deploy
```

The command will take care of downloading the version defined in package.json,
patch it, and deploy it in /lib/vendors. Look at Gruntfile.js to see in details what it does.


## How to edit the CSS files?

All the less and css files of passbolt are managed through a styleguide.
https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_styleguide

You can also develop an alternative stylesheet and include it manually if you only want some styling changes for your own version of the browser add-on.
If you want your changes to be included in an official release, you will have to submit the changes in the official styleguide.

### How to update the styleguide?

The styelguide version number is located in package.json. To deploy a new version of the styleguide, first you need to install grunt:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install the needed modules defined in package.json
```
npm install
```

Install the styleguide
```
grunt styleguide-update
```

## Distributing the add-on

In order to distribute the addon you will need to get it reviewed and signed by Mozilla.
See. https://addons.mozilla.org/
