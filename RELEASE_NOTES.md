Version 4.5.1 is exclusively a Passbolt browser extension maintenance release designed to address a problem that emerged with the earlier 4.5.0 release. This issue prevented Chrome users who run the Passbolt API from a subdirectory from establishing a connection.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to the community members who brought this issue to our attention and assisted the team in resolving it.
